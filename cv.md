## About Me

I have been working in IT for more than 6 years and have performed several roles: 
* Service Desk Specialist, 
* Service Desk Manager, 
* Project Coordinator, 
* Release Manager.

I am currently aspiring to dive deeper into a project life cycle, and this includes the development process. That is why it is important to me to learn programming.
